1. We have a user/ client(Browser) who enters a url (ex. http://my-page.com)
2. Now behind the scenes the browser reaches out to some domain name servers(dns). Server as some IP address.
3. Now the browser will send a request to that server using the server's ip address(at 10.212.212.12)
4. Now the code hosted on that server will execute and will spin up the server that will handle that request sent to the server.
5. The response of that request can be for example a HTML page.
6. Communication can happen with the database(aka backend).
7. There is a standardized protocol for transferring data that is understood by the browser and server (HTTP & HTTPS) - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol &  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure
